# 🌿 Spring Framework Learning Repository

Welcome to my Spring Framework learning repository!  
This project is structured into three learning phases, each represented by a separate directory. Each phase explores different aspects of the Spring ecosystem, from core annotations to advanced database integration.

---

## 📁 1. Exploration-Spring-Framework

This module focuses on foundational concepts of the Spring Framework.

### 🔍 Concepts Covered:
- Introduction to the Spring Framework
- Understanding and using interfaces
- Dependency Injection (DI) basics
- Component scanning mechanism
- `@Component` annotation for bean registration
- `@Configuration` annotation for Java-based configuration

---

## 📁 2. Spring-Framework-Annotation

This module explores advanced Spring annotations and bean lifecycle management.

### 🔍 Concepts Covered:
- `@Component` for defining beans
- Bean scopes (Singleton and Prototype) using `@Scope`
- Setting primary beans using `@Primary`
- Alternative annotations like `@Named`
- Lazy initialization with `@Lazy`
- Lifecycle hooks with `@PostConstruct`
- Constructor-based dependency injection
- Working with multiple beans and resolving conflicts

---

## 📁 3. JPA-Hibernate

This module introduces Spring's integration with relational databases using JDBC and JPA.

### 🔍 Concepts Covered:
- Using `@Repository` for data access layer
- Database operations with `JdbcTemplate`
- Writing SQL queries for insert, delete, and select
- Managing transactions with `@Transactional`
- Using `EntityManager` for JPA operations
- Building Spring Data JPA repositories using `JpaRepository`
- Bootstrapping operations using `CommandLineRunner`

---

## 📚 Purpose of the Repository

This repository serves as a progressive journey through the Spring Framework:
- To understand how Spring manages dependencies and configurations
- To learn about the lifecycle of beans and their scopes
- To build persistence layers using JDBC, JPA, and Spring Data JPA

Each directory builds upon the previous one, providing a strong conceptual and practical grasp of modern Spring development.
